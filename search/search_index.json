Make sure that the maximum length is not too short so that the image URL fits in (note that the default maximum length for input_text helpers created from the HA web interface is 100 characters, but you can create your own input_text in <code>configuration.yaml</code> of maximum length 255). In case the image path is too long for the helper, you will get a warning in HA logs (sounding like <code>Invalid value: ... (length range 0 - 100)</code>) and the entity will not get updated. When the screensaver changes the active image, the URL of the new image is stored in this entity.</p>"},{"location":"styling/","title":"Styling","text":"<p>You can use the <code>theme</code> configuration option to specify the theme for the WallPanel Info Box.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>wallpanel:\n  theme: Frosted Glass\n</code></pre> <p>You can customize the style of every WallPanel element.</p> <p>The most important element IDs are:</p> <ul> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-container</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-info-box</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-info-box-content</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-info-box-badges</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-info-box-views</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-image-background</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-image-info</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-image-overlay</code></li> <li><code>wallpanel-screensaver-overlay</code></li> </ul> <p>Use the <code>style</code> configuration attribute and add a key for the element ID for which you want to set style attributes.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>style:\n  wallpanel-screensaver-overlay:\n    background: '#00000055'\n  wallpanel-screensaver-info-box-content:\n    background: '#ffffff'\n</code></pre> <p>The following CSS custom properties (variables) can be used to set styles for all added cards, the defaults are: <pre><code>style:\n  wallpanel-screensaver-info-box:\n    '--wp-card-width': 500px\n    '--wp-card-margin': 5px\n    '--wp-card-padding': 0px\n    '--wp-card-backdrop-filter': none\n</code></pre> You can add the <code>wp_style</code> attribute for individual cards and badges to set CSS styles as needed.</p> <p>Example</p> <pre><code>cards:\n  -
