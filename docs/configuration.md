## Home Assistant Dashboard configuration
You can add the configuration to your Home Assistant Dashboard configuration yaml (raw config).

* Click Overview in your sidebar.
* Click the three dots menu (top-right) and click on Edit Dashboard.
* Click the three dots menu again and click on Raw configuration editor.
* Add the `wallpanel` configuration above anything else.

**Short example**:
```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  hide_toolbar: true
  hide_sidebar: true
  fullscreen: true
```

**Extended example**:
```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  enabled_on_views:
    - default_view
  debug: false
  hide_toolbar: true
  hide_sidebar: true
  fullscreen: true
  idle_time: 10
  keep_screen_on_time: 86400
  black_screen_after_time: 7200
  control_reactivation_time: 1.0
  screensaver_start_navigation_path: /lovelace/default_view
  image_url: 'http://picsum.photos/${width}/${height}?random=${timestamp}'
  image_fit_landscape: cover
  media_list_update_interval: 3600
  media_order: 'sorted'
  image_excludes: []
  show_image_info: false
  fetch_address_data: true
  image_info_template: '${address.town|address.city!prefix=!suffix= // }${DateTimeOriginal!options=year:numeric,month:long}'
  screensaver_entity: input_boolean.wallpanel_screensaver
  info_animation_duration_x: 30
  info_animation_duration_y: 11
  info_animation_timing_function_x: 'ease-in-out'
  info_animation_timing_function_y: 'ease-in-out'
  info_move_pattern: random
  info_move_interval: 0
  info_move_fade_duration: 2.0
  content_interaction: true
  style:
    wallpanel-screensaver-info-box:
      font-size: 8vh
      font-weight: 600
      color: '#eeeeee'
      text-shadow: '-2px -2px 0 #03a9f4, 2px -2px 0 #03a9f4, -2px 2px 0 #03a9f4, 2px 2px 0 #03a9f4'
```

## URL query parameters
It is also possible to pass configuration parameters in the query string.
These parameters (**wp_<parameter\>**) will override the corresponding properties in the yaml configuration.
Use JSON syntax for the values.

**Example**:
`http://hass:8123/lovelace/default_view?wp_hide_sidebar=false`

!!! info
    Please note that the URL parameters may be lost when navigating in the Home Assistant interface.
    Therefore, this option should not normally be used.

## Dynamic configuration using placeholders
The WallPanel configuration can be changed dynamically by using input_text or input_select helpers.
Placeholders can be used in the yaml configuration, which are replaced by the state value of the corresponding entity.
These placeholders have the form `${entity:<entity-id>}`, where `<entity-id>` must be replaced by the ID of an existing HA entity.
Whenever the state of such an entity changes, the configuration is updated immediately.

For the example, an input_select helper named `wallpanel_image_url` must be created in HA.
The enity ID of the helper will be `input_select.wallpanel_image_url` by default.
A placeholder can now be inserted in the yaml configuration:
```yaml
wallpanel:
  image_url: '${entity:input_select.wallpanel_image_url}'
```
Whenever the state of the entity is changed manually or by automation, the configuration is updated accordingly.

It is also possible to dynamically change only a part of the configuration value:
```yaml
wallpanel:
  image_url: 'https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?client_id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY&query=${entity:input_text.wallpanel_unsplash_query}'
```

If Browser Mod is available, you can also use the `${browser_id}` placeholder:
```yaml
wallpanel:
  screensaver_entity: input_boolean.${browser_id}_wallpanel_screensaver
```
See [Browser Mod - Placeholder ${browser_id}](browser-mod.md#placeholder-browser_id) for details.


## Profiles
With profiles you can easily switch between different configurations.
Each profile is defined under the `profiles` attribute, while settings outside of a profile serve as the default configuration.

**Example**

```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  idle_time: 60
  style:
    wallpanel-screensaver-overlay:
      background: '#00000000'
  profiles:
    night:
      idle_time: 5
      style:
        wallpanel-screensaver-overlay:
          background: '#000000bb'
    black:
      black_screen_after_time: 1
    user.jane:
      enabled: false
    device.e9a2c86e_5526f1ee:
      idle_time: 25
      screensaver_entity: input_boolean.kitchen_wallpanel_screensaver
```

In this example, there are four additional profiles: `night`, `black`, `user.jane` and `device.e9a2c86e_5526f1ee`.
When a profile is activated, its settings override the default configuration.

### Activating a Profile
There are several ways to activate a profile:

**1. Automatic Activation for User Profiles**

A user profile is automatically applied if it matches the logged-in user.

* The name of a user profile must begin with `user.`, followed by a user ID or display name (usernames are not supported).
* The display name of the logged-in user is converted to lowercase, and spaces are replaced with underscores (`_`). For example, `Jane Doe` would be converted to `jane_doe`.

!!! tip
    The ID of a user can be found when you click on a user entry in Settings => Persons => [Users](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/users/)

**2. Automatic Activation for Device Profiles**

A device profile is activated if it matches the Browser Mod Browser ID.

* The profile name must begin with `device.`, followed by the Browser ID configured in Browser Mod.
* Any hyphens (`-`) in the Browser ID are replaced with underscores (`_`).

For more details, refer to [Integration with Browser Mod](browser-mod.md).

**3. Dynamic Activation via an Input Helper**

Profiles can be dynamically switched using an `input_text` or `input_select` helper.

* In the example, an `input_text` helper named `wallpanel_profile` must be created in Home Assistant.
* The profile can then be changed by updating `input_text.wallpanel_profile` manually or through automation (e.g., based on time).
* Setting it to a valid profile name applies that profile immediately. Any value that does not match a defined profile will revert to the default settings.


```yaml
wallpanel:
  profile_entity: input_text.wallpanel_profile
```

**4. Manual Activation via Configuration**

You can specify a profile directly in the wallpanel configuration, although this method is rarely needed.

```yaml
wallpanel:
  profile: night
```

**5. Activation via Query String Parameter**

A profile can be selected using a URL parameter:
`http://hass:8123/lovelace/default_view?wp_profile=night`

## Enable WallPanel on specific Views
To enable WallPanel only on specific views, use the `enabled_on_views` configuration option.

This option accepts a list of view paths where WallPanel should be active. You can find the path in your dashboard’s YAML configuration or directly from the browser URL.

For example, in the URL below, the path of the view is `1`:

```
https://hass:8123/dashboard-test/1
```

If you leave the list empty, WallPanel will be enabled on all views by default.
